		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>I was born in Columbia, South Carolina but grew up in Charlottesville, Virginia where my parents still live today. Charlottesville is a beautiful and small town where we are most known for our food and local vineyards.</p>
		<p>I go to college at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Virginia. Fredericksburg is much bigger than Charlottesville, with a historic downtown district and lots of great coffee shops. I am currently going into my last semester of my bachelor's degree, where I will earn a B.S. in computer science. I originally came into the school wanting to study economics, however after taking Professor Finlayson's intro to computer science, I got hooked on programming.</p>
		<p>During my time at Mary Washington, I have worked at a few different restaurants; my current job being a server at Tapa Rio, a Latin-Italian restaurant in downtown Fredericksburg. </p>
		<p>When I am not working or studying, I am more than likely found at Lee's Hill golf club (where I double the course record everytime), the gym, or playing Ultimate Frisbee. Some of my other hobbies include:<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Skiing</li>
			<li>Playing Guitar</li>
			<li>Video Games</li>
			<li>Drinking Coffee</li>
		</ul>
